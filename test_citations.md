# Test Paper on Citation Formats

## Introduction

This research builds on previous studies [1] that examined the effectiveness of citation parsing [2, 3]. Several methodologies have been explored [4-6] to standardize reference formats.

## Related Work

Multiple approaches [1, 5, 7-9] have been proposed to handle various citation styles. Recent developments [10](https://example.com/doi10) and [11](https://doi.org/10.1000/example) show promising results.

## Methodology

Our study follows the framework established by [1] and extends it using techniques from [2, 3, 4]. The implementation incorporates lessons learned from [5-8] while addressing limitations noted in [9, 10].

## Results

The results demonstrate improvements over baseline methods [1-3] with statistical significance.
