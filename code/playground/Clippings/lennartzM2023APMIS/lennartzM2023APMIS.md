title: 'Cytokeratin 13 ( \textscCK13 ) Expression in Cancer: A Tissue Microarray Study
  on 10,439 Tumors'
---
## Abstract

Cytokeratin 13 (CK13) is a type I acidic low molecular weight cytokeratin, which is mainly expressed in urothelium and in the squamous epithelium of various sites of origin. Loss of CK13 has been implicated in the development and progression of squamous epithelial neoplasms. To comprehensively determine CK13 expression in normal and neoplastic tissues, a tissue microarray containing 10,439 samples from 131 different tumor types and subtypes as well as 608 samples of 76 different normal tissue types was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. CK13 immunostaining was detectable in 42 (32.1%) of the 131 tumor categories including 24 (18.3%) tumor types with at least one strongly positive case. The highest rate of positive staining was found in various urothelial neoplasms (52.1–92.3%) including Brenner tumor of the ovary (86.8%) and in squamous cell carcinomas from various sites of origin (39.1–77.6%), Warthin tumors of parotid glands (66.7%), adenosquamous carcinomas of the cervix (33.3%), thymomas (16.0%), and endometroid carcinomas of the ovary (15.3%). Twenty other epithelial or germ cell neoplasms showed – a usually weak – CK13 positivity in less than 15% of the cases. In bladder cancer, reduced CK13 expression was linked to high grade and advanced stage (p < 0.0001 each). In squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, reduced CK13 immunostaining was related to high grade (p = 0.0295) and shortened recurrence-free (p = 0.0094) and overall survival (p = 0.0274). In a combined analysis of 1,151 squamous cell carcinomas from 11 different sites of origin, reduced CK13 staining was linked to high grade (p = 0.0050). Our data provide a comprehensive overview on CK13 expression in normal and neoplastic human tissues. CK13 expression predominates in urothelial neoplasms and in squamous cell carcinomas of different organs, and a loss of CK13 expression is associated with aggressive disease in these tumors.

Antibodies against cytokeratins are commonly used for immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses in surgical pathology because these proteins often show organ- and cell type specific expression, which is typically retained in cancers derived from these cells (summarized in \[[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0001), [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0002)\]). IHC detection of specific cytokeratins is, for example, useful to characterize metastatic cancer tissue for which the site of the primary tumor is yet unknown.

Cytokeratins (CKs) are intermediate filaments that protect cells against mechanical stress. They are present in virtually all epithelial cells and some other cell types where they braid the nucleus, span through the cytoplasm, and attach to the cytoplasmic plaques of the desmosomes \[[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0003) - [5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0005)\]. CKs form heteropolymers of type I (acidic) and type II (basic) filaments. Cytokeratin 13 (CK13), encoded by the keratin 13 (KRT13) gene at chromosome 17q21, is a type I acidic low molecular weight cytokeratin. It mainly forms heterodimers with CK4 (type II) in squamous epithelium of various sites of origin \[[6](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0006) - [8](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0008)\], and with the simple-epithelium-type type II CKs 7 and/or 8 in the urothelium \[[9](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0009), [10](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0010)\]. Accordingly, studies on CK13 expression in cancer have focused on neoplasms derived from the squamous epithelium. Several authors have found that reduced CK13 staining in squamous epithelium may represent a feature of dysplasia, and it was proposed that CK13 IHC may be useful for diagnosing dysplasia with higher reliability than by histology alone \[[11](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0011) - [15](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0015)\]. Others have suggested that a reduced CK13 expression in these tumors may be linked to poor prognosis in squamous cell carcinomas from cervix \[[16](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0016) - [18](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0018)\], oral cavity \[[19](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0019) - [24](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0024)\], and head and neck \[[21](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0021), [22](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0022), [25](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0025)\]. However, data on the prevalence of CK13 expression are controversial for many cancers. For example, the CK13 positivity rates of squamous cell carcinomas ranged from 33% to 80% in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung \[[26](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0026) - [28](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0028)\], 25–100% in squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix uteri \[[17](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0017), [18](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0018), [29](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0029)\], 0–49% in squamous cell carcinomas of the skin \[[28](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0028), [30](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0030)\], 0–100% in squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus \[[28](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0028), [31](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0031), [32](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0032)\], 0–100% in squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity \[[19](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0019), [26](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0026), [33](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0033)\], and 0–97% in gastric adenocarcinoma \[[28](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0028), [34](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0034)\]. These conflicting data are likely to be caused by using different antibodies, immunostaining protocols, and criteria to determine CK13 positivity in these studies.

To better understand the prevalence and significance of CK13 expression in cancer as well as the potential diagnostic utility of CK13 IHC, a comprehensive study analyzing a large number of neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues under highly standardized conditions is needed. Therefore, CK13 expression was analyzed in more than 10,000 tumor tissue samples from 131 different tumor types and subtypes as well as 76 non-neoplastic tissue categories by IHC in a tissue microarray (TMA) format in this study.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

### Tissue microarrays

The normal tissue TMA was composed of eight samples from eight different donors for each of the 76 different normal tissue types (608 samples on one slide). The cancer TMAs contained a total of 10,439 primary tumors from 131 tumor types and subtypes. Detailed histopathological data on grade, pathological tumor stage (pT), or pathological lymph node status (pN) were available from subsets of urothelial carcinomas (n = 1073), cervical squamous cell carcinomas (n = 179), as well as of 1160 squamous cell carcinomas of different sites of origin. Clinical follow-up data were available from 157 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix. The median follow-up time was 47 months (overall survival, range: 0–181 months) or 49 months (recurrence-free survival, range: 0-181 months). The composition of both normal and cancer TMAs is described in detail in the results section. All samples were retrieved from the archives of the Institutes of Pathology, University Hospital of Hamburg, Germany, the Institute of Pathology, Clinical Center Osnabrueck, Germany, and the Department of Pathology, Academic Hospital Fuerth, Germany. Tissues were fixed in 4% buffered formalin and then embedded in paraffin. The TMA manufacturing process has previously been described in detail \[[35](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0035), [36](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0036)\]. In brief, one tissue spot (diameter: 0.6 mm) was transferred from a cancer containing or normal tissue donor block to an empty recipient paraffin block. The use of archived remnants of diagnostic tissues for manufacturing of TMAs and their analysis for research purposes as well as patient data analysis has been approved by local laws (HmbKHG, §12) and by the local ethics committee (Ethics commission Hamburg, WF-049/09). All work has been carried out in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.

### Immunohistochemistry

Freshly prepared TMA sections were immunostained on one day in one experiment. Slides were deparaffinized with xylol, rehydrated through a graded alcohol series, and exposed to heat-induced antigen retrieval for 5 min in an autoclave at 121°C in pH 7.8 DakoTarget Retrieval Solution™ (Sant Clara, Agilent, CA, USA). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with Dako Peroxidase Blocking Solution™ (Sant Clara, Agilent, CA, USA; #52023) for 10 minutes. Primary antibody specific for CK13 protein (mouse monoclonal, MSVA-613M, cat. # 2373-613M, MS Validated Antibodies GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) was applied at 37°C for 60 minutes at a dilution of 1:150. For the purpose of antibody validation, the normal tissue TMA was also analyzed by antibody EP69 (rabbit monoclonal, BSB 6678, BioSB, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) at a dilution of 1:300 and an otherwise identical protocol. Bound antibody was visualized using the EnVision Kit™ (Sant Clara, Agilent, CA, USA; #K5007) according to the manufacturer's directions. The sections were counterstained with haemalaun. For tumor tissues, the percentage of CK13-positive tumor cells was estimated, and the staining intensity was semi-quantitatively recorded (0, 1+, 2+, 3+). For statistical analyses, the staining results were categorized into four groups as follows: Negative: no staining at all, weak staining: staining intensity of 1+ in ≤70% of tumor cells or staining intensity of 2+ in ≤30% of tumor cells, moderate staining: staining intensity of 1+ in >70% of tumor cells, staining intensity of 2+ in >30% but in ≤70% of tumor cells or staining intensity of 3+ in ≤30% of tumor cells, strong staining: staining intensity of 2+ in >70% of tumor cells or staining intensity of 3+ in >30% of tumor cells.

### Statistics

Statistical calculations were performed with JMP 16 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Contingency tables and the chi <sup>2</sup> -test were performed to search for associations between CK13 immunostaining and tumor phenotype in urothelial carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of different sites of origin. Survival curves were calculated according to Kaplan-Meier. The Log-Rank test was applied to detect significant differences between groups. A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

## RESULTS

### Technical issues

A total of 9,156 (87.7%) of 10,439 tumor samples and at least 4 normal samples per tissue category were interpretable in our TMA analysis. Noninterpretable samples demonstrated a lack of unequivocal tumor cells or an absence of tissue in the respective TMA spots.

### CK13 in normal tissues

CK13 immunostaining was usually strong in all supra-basal cell layers of non-keratinizing squamous epithelia from various sites while it was weak or absent in basal cells. CK13 staining was usually absent in the skin (including hair follicles and sebaceous glands), but scattered CK13-positive cells occasionally occurred in variable quantities in certain topographical areas, for example, in the anal skin. Very few scattered CK13-positive individual cells or small groups of cells could also occur in excretory ducts of salivary glands, few cells in the respiratory epithelium as well as in basal cells of the prostate and seminal vesicle. CK13 was also positive in corpuscles of Hassall's and epithelial cells in the medulla - but not the cortex - of the thymus, squamous epithelium of tonsil crypts, transitional epithelium of the anal canal, and the urothelium (except umbrella cells). Occasionally, CK13 staining was also seen in subsets of endometrial epithelial cells and in basal cell layers of endocervical glands. All these findings were observed by the antibodies MSVA-613M and EP69 (Figure [S1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#support-information-section)). CK13 immunostaining was absent in the gastrointestinal epithelium, gallbladder, liver, pancreas, lung, fallopian tube, ovary, placenta, lymphatic, hematopoetic and mesenchymal tissues, brain, thyroid, adrenal, pituitary, and parathyroid glands. Representative images of CK13 immunostaining in normal tissues are shown in Figure  [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-fig-0001).

Fig. 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint CK13 immunostaining of normal tissues. The panels show strong CK13 staining of all cell layers except umbrella cells in the urothelium of the urinary bladder (A), all cell layers of the squamous epithelium of the esophagus (B), all cell layers except the basal cells of squamous epithelium of the uterine cervix (C) while staining is absent in squamous epithelium of the skin (D). In the thymus, CK13 staining occurs in corpuscles of Hassall's and other epithelial cells of the medulla (E). In the tonsil crypts, a subset of squamous epithelial cells stains positive (F). CK13 staining is absent in the kidney (G) and the appendix (H).

### CK13 in cancer tissues

CK13 immunostaining was detectable in 1,563 (17.1%) of the 9,156 analyzable tumors, including 665 (7.3%) with weak, 258 (2.8%) with moderate, and 640 (7.0%) with strong immunostaining. Overall, 42 (32.1%) of 131 tumor categories showed detectable CK13 expression with 24 (18.3%) tumor categories including at least one case with strong positivity (Table [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-tbl-0001 "Link to table")). Representative images of CK13-positive tumors are shown in Figure  [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-fig-0002). The highest rate of positive staining was found in various categories of urothelial neoplasms (52.1–92.3%) including Brenner tumor of the ovary (86.8%) and in squamous cell carcinomas from various sites of origin (39.1–77.6%), Warthin tumors of salivary glands (66.7%), adenosquamous carcinomas of the cervix (33.3%), thymomas (16.0%), and endometroid carcinomas of the ovary (15.3%). Twenty other epithelial or germ cell neoplasms showed – a usually weak – CK13 positivity in less than 15% of cases. In a fraction of these rarely CK13-positive tumor entities, focal CK13 staining was occasionally seen in areas of squamous differentiation (Figure  [2G](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-fig-0002)), but CK13 expression also occurred in tumors clearly lacking such morphological features (Figure  [2F](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-fig-0002)). CK13 staining was always absent in hematological and mesenchymal neoplasms. A ranking order of tumor categories according to their rate of CK13 positive and strongly positive cases is given in Figure  [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-fig-0003). The relationship between CK13 immunostaining and histopathological features in urothelial and squamous cell carcinomas is given in Table  [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-tbl-0002 "Link to table"). In bladder cancer, a significant reduction of CK13 expression was seen in tumors with high grade and advanced stage (p < 0.0001). In squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, reduced CK13 immunostaining was linked to high grade (p = 0.0295) as well as shortened recurrence-free (p = 0.0094; Figure  [4A](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-fig-0004)) and overall survival (p = 0.0274; Figure  [4B](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-fig-0004)). In a combined analysis of 1,151 squamous cell carcinomas from 11 different sites of origin, reduced CK13 staining was linked to high grade (p = 0.0050) and absence of HPV infection (p = 0.0002). However, a separate analysis of 9 different squamous cell carcinoma entities did not show significant differences in the HPV status between tumors with high and low CK13 expression (Table  [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-tbl-0003 "Link to table")).

## DISCUSSION

Our successful analysis of 9,156 tumors from 131 entities identified CK13 expression in 42 of 131 analyzed cancer categories and enabled the definition of a ranking order of tumor types according to their rate of CK13-positive cases (Figure [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-fig-0003), Table  [S1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#support-information-section)). The obtained data fit well with a predominant role of CK13 for squamous cell and urothelial carcinoma. The 11 analyzed categories of squamous cell carcinomas derived from different sites of origin were all among the 19 top positions of our CK13 ranking list (all positive in ≥39%). A similarly high rate of CK13 positivity was only observed in urothelial neoplasms. Several ancient studies had already described CK13 immunostaining in normal urothelium and in urothelial carcinomas \[[37](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0037), [38](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0038)\]. RNA expression data derived from the “The Cancer Genome Atlas” (TCGA) also described urothelial carcinomas as the only cancer entity with similar frequency and levels of CK13 expression as seen in squamous cell carcinomas \[[39](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0039)\]. Overall, these findings mirror the expression pattern of CK13 in normal tissues, which is largely limited to urothelium and squamous epithelium. The virtual absence of CK13 staining in cutaneous basal cell carcinomas also fits with normal tissue data because the basal cell layer is typically exempted from CK13 positivity in squamous epithelium.

The occasional expression of CK13 in other cancer types can be due to at least three different reasons including tumor origin from rare CK13 positive normal cells, focal squamous cell differentiation of non-squamous cell neoplasms, and neo-expression of CK13 in dedifferentiated cancer cells without squamous cell morphology. Physiologic CK13 expression of some normal cells in salivary glands could result in CK13 positivity of salivary gland tumors derived from such cells. This may even apply for Warthin's tumor, one of the most commonly CK13 positive non-squamous cell carcinoma. The epithelial component of Warthin's tumor is composed of a bilayered epithelium, comprising inner columnar eosinophilic or oncocytic cells surrounded by smaller basal cells \[[40](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0040)\]. A relationship of these epithelial cells to squamous differentiation is supported by the frequent finding of squamous like epithelial cells in fine needle aspirates of these tumors and the occasional development of squamous metaplasia and squamous cell carcinomas in these tumors \[[40](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0040)\]. Squamous cell differentiation can occur in a broad range of carcinoma types and is likely the cause for at least a fraction of CK13-positive cases in cancers of the stomach, pancreas, breast, and the ovary. In all these tumor entities, squamous cell differentiation has been described in 0.4% to 10% of cases \[[41](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0041) - [47](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0047)\]. Since cellular dedifferentiation is associated with cancer progression, the expression of many genes, most of which are not relevant for tumor cell behavior, becomes deregulated \[[48](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0048), [49](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0049)\]. It is therefore possible that rare CK13 positivity in a fraction of cells in non-squamous and non-urothelial neoplasms can represent a random phenomenon without a functionally relevant role although aberrant expression of proteins is often linked to unfavorable tumor behavior.

The significant association between reduced CK13 expression and high grade and unfavorable prognosis in more than 150 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the uterine cervix and the significant link between CK13 expression loss and high grade in a collection of 856 squamous cell carcinomas of 11 different organs is in line with findings of several previous studies. A significant relationship between reduced CK13 staining in squamous cell carcinomas and poor patient outcome or adverse tumor features had been found in cervical carcinomas \[[16](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0016) - [18](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0018)\], oral cavity carcinomas \[[19](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0019) - [24](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0024)\], and other head and neck carcinomas \[[21](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0021), [22](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0022), [25](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0025)\]. Significant associations of CK13 loss with prognostically unfavorable tumor features such as poor grade, advanced stage or nodal metastasis have been found in urothelial carcinomas \[[8](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0008), [37](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0037), [50](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0050) - [52](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0052)\] and gastric carcinomas \[[34](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0034)\]. Given the lack of known tumor suppressive functions of CK13, reduced or lost expression of this protein may reflect a feature of incomplete squamous cell dedifferentiation that usually accompanies tumor progression, and which is commonly linked to poor prognosis \[[48](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0048)\]. In many instances, CK13 loss may occur early in the development of squamous cell carcinomas as several authors have described a reduced expression of CK13 in 23–89% of cases with squamous cell dysplasia \[[8](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0008), [14](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0014), [17](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0017) - [19](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0019), [53](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0053) - [60](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0060)\]. It was therefore suggested that CK13 IHC might be useful for the detection of dysplastic squamous epithelium \[[11](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0011) - [15](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0015)\]. Considering the lack of CK13 staining in normal keratinizing squamous epithelium, a reciprocal situation may occur in squamous cell neoplasms of the skin. However, in a study on 71 squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, Hudson et al. \[[30](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0030)\] found CK13 positivity in 58% of grade 1, 43% of grade 2, and in 0% of grade 3 cancers. The significant association between CK13 loss and high grade of malignancy and invasive tumor growth in urothelial carcinoma found in this study parallels the situation in squamous cell carcinomas and also matches previous published findings. Published frequencies of CK13 positivity range from 47% to 100% in non-invasive papillary urothelial carcinomas and from 0% to 67% in muscle invasive urothelial carcinomas \[[50](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0050) - [52](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0052)\]. The finding of a reduced CK13 expression in biopsies from patients with bladder exstrophy hints towards a possible role of CK13 IHC for assessing urothelial dysplasia \[[61](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0061)\]. However, studies evaluating the potential role of CK13 loss as a marker for urothelial dysplasia and as a marker for bladder cancer prognosis in significant patient cohorts are still lacking.

Considering the large scale of our study, our assay was extensively validated by comparing our IHC findings in normal tissues with data obtained by another independent anti-CK13 antibody and RNA data derived from three different publicly accessible databases \[[62](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0062) - [65](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0065)\]. To ensure that the widest possible range of proteins would be tested for potenital cross-reactivity, 76 different normal tissues categories were included in this analysis. Validity of our assay was supported by the detection of significant CK13 immunostaining in all organs with documented CK13 RNA expression (esophagus, salivary gland, urinary bladder, vagina, cervix, and tonsil). Except for salivary gland, all these tissues contain non-keratinizing squamous epithelium or urothelium. Additional scattered CK13-positive cells or groups of cells in the respiratory epithelium, endometrium, endocervix, or in basal cells of the prostate and seminal vesicle, for which CK13 RNA expression had not been described, were confirmed by the independent second CK13 antibody EP69. In these organs, the CK13 positive cells constitute such a small fraction of the total number of cells that CK13 RNA may not occur at detectable quantities in whole organ tissue samples. As we are certain that our assay was highly specific, it is also of note that we were unable to confirm high frequencies of CK13 positivity in several tumor entities such as adenocarcinoma of the colon \[[66](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0066), [67](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0067)\], diffuse type of gastric adenocarcinoma \[[34](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0034)\], and small cell carcinoma of the lung \[[8](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0008)\] for which high positivity rates had previously been described (Figure  [5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-fig-0005)).

An “X” indicates the fraction of CK13 positive cancers in the present study, dots indicate the reported frequencies from the literature for comparison: yellow dots mark studies with ≤25 analyzed tumors, green dots mark studies with 26–99 analyzed tumors, and red dots mark studies with >100 analyzed tumors.

## CONCLUSIONS

In summary, our data provide a comprehensive overview on CK13 expression in normal and neoplastic human tissues. CK13 expression predominates in urothelial neoplasms and in squamous cell carcinomas. In these tumors, reduced CK13 expression goes along with aggressive disease. The role of CK13 expression analysis as a marker for dysplasia and prognosis in urothelial and squamous cell neoplasms deserves further evaluation.
