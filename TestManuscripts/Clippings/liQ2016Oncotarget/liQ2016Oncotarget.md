## Abstract

Prostate cancer metastasis to bone and brain represents a major clinical challenge. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying organ-specific metastasis is crucial for developing targeted therapies¹,². Keratin 13 (KRT13) has emerged as a potential regulator of metastatic behavior in various cancer types³.

## Introduction

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men⁴. While primary tumors are often manageable, metastatic disease remains largely incurable⁵⁻⁷. The most common sites of prostate cancer metastasis are bone and brain⁸. Recent studies have highlighted the role of cytoskeletal proteins in metastatic processes⁹,¹⁰.

Keratin 13 (KRT13) is a type I intermediate filament protein normally expressed in stratified epithelial tissues¹¹. Aberrant KRT13 expression has been observed in several cancer types and has been associated with altered cellular behavior¹²⁻¹⁴. However, its role in prostate cancer metastasis has not been thoroughly investigated.

## Methods and Materials

### Cell Culture and Transfection

Human prostate cancer cell lines PC3, DU145, and LNCaP were obtained from ATCC and cultured under standard conditions¹⁵. KRT13 overexpression was achieved using lentiviral vectors as described previously¹⁶,¹⁷. Stable cell lines were selected and maintained under appropriate selection pressure.

### Migration and Invasion Assays

Cell migration was assessed using wound healing assays and Transwell migration chambers¹⁸. Invasion assays were performed using Matrigel-coated Transwell chambers (Wilson & Brown, 2020; Smith et al., 2019). Results were quantified using standard protocols¹⁹⁻²¹.

## Results

### KRT13 Expression Alters Cellular Morphology

Overexpression of KRT13 in prostate cancer cells resulted in significant morphological changes²². Cells exhibited increased elongation and enhanced spindle-like appearance, consistent with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characteristics²³,²⁴. These changes were observed across multiple cell lines tested.

### Enhanced Migration and Invasion Capacity

KRT13-overexpressing cells showed significantly enhanced migration capacity compared to control cells (p < 0.01)²⁵. Invasion assays revealed a 3-fold increase in invasive potential in KRT13-positive cells²⁶⁻²⁸. The enhanced invasive behavior was consistent across different experimental conditions.

### Organ-Specific Metastatic Behavior

In vivo studies demonstrated that KRT13 expression reprograms metastatic tropism²⁹. Cells with high KRT13 expression showed preferential colonization of bone and brain tissues³⁰,³¹. This organ-specific behavior was associated with altered expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors³²⁻³⁴.

## Discussion

Our findings reveal that KRT13 acts as a key regulator of prostate cancer metastasis to bone and brain. The mechanism appears to involve reprogramming of cellular adhesion properties and migration behavior³⁵. These results suggest that KRT13 could serve as both a prognostic marker and therapeutic target³⁶,³⁷.

The role of intermediate filaments in cancer metastasis is an active area of research³⁸. Previous studies have shown that other keratin family members can influence metastatic behavior in various cancer types³⁹⁻⁴¹. However, the specific contribution of KRT13 to organ-specific metastasis has not been previously demonstrated.

## Conclusion

Keratin 13 expression reprograms prostate cancer cells to exhibit enhanced metastatic potential specifically to bone and brain tissues. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying organ-specific metastasis and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for advanced prostate cancer (see reviews: Johnson et al., 2020; Garcia & Martinez, 2021)⁴².
