## Abstract

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers, with a 5-year survival rate of <10%. Radiotherapy is a key treatment modality, but radioresistance often limits its efficacy¹. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subset of cancer cells that exhibit self-renewal capacity and are thought to contribute to tumor progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance including radioresistance (Ahmed et al., 2018).

## Introduction

Recent studies have shown that CSCs play crucial roles in radioresistance mechanisms [1]. The identification of CSC markers is essential for understanding and overcoming radioresistance in PDAC. Keratin 13 (KRT13) is a type I intermediate filament protein that has been implicated in various cancer types (Brown & Wilson, 2021).

## Methods

We analyzed KRT13 expression in pancreatic cancer cell lines and patient samples. Cell viability assays were performed using standard protocols [2,3]. For radiation sensitivity testing, cells were exposed to various doses of ionizing radiation (0-10 Gy) and survival was assessed (Thompson et al., 2020).

Cancer stem-like cells were identified using multiple markers including CD133, CD44, and ALDH1 activity [4] – [6]. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to characterize the stem cell populations. Sphere formation assays were conducted as described previously [7; 8].

## Results

KRT13 expression was significantly upregulated in pancreatic cancer stem-like cells compared to non-stem cancer cells (p < 0.001). High KRT13 expression was associated with increased radioresistance in vitro and in vivo [9], [10]. Cells with elevated KRT13 levels showed enhanced DNA repair capacity and reduced apoptosis following radiation exposure.

Gene expression analysis revealed that KRT13 regulates several pathways involved in stemness maintenance and radiation response [11,12,13]. The protein interacts with key transcription factors involved in stem cell biology (Davis & Lee, 2019; Miller et al., 2020).

## Discussion

Our findings suggest that KRT13 is a novel CSC marker in pancreatic cancer and contributes to radioresistance. The upregulation of KRT13 in CSCs may be mediated through multiple signaling pathways [14]. These results have important implications for radiation therapy strategies in PDAC patients.

The role of intermediate filaments in cancer stem cell biology is an emerging area of research. Previous studies have shown similar patterns in other keratin family members [15], [16]. However, the specific mechanisms by which KRT13 confers radioresistance require further investigation.

## Conclusion

KRT13 is upregulated in pancreatic cancer stem-like cells and associated with radioresistance. Targeting KRT13 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome radiation resistance in pancreatic cancer. Further studies are needed to validate these findings in clinical settings (see review by Garcia et al., 2022).
