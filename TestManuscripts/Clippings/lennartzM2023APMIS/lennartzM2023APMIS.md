# Cytokeratin 13 (CK13) expression in cancer: a tissue microarray study

## Abstract

Cytokeratin 13 (CK13) is a type I keratin that is normally expressed in non-keratinizing squamous epithelia. We examined CK13 expression in 10,439 different tumors. Our results show that CK13 is overexpressed in several cancer types and may serve as a diagnostic marker.

## Introduction

Antibodies against cytokeratins are commonly used for immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses in surgical pathology because these proteins often show organ- and cell type specific expression, which is typically retained in cancers derived from these cells (summarized in \[[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0001), [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0002)\]). IHC detection of specific cytokeratins is, for example, useful to characterize metastatic cancer tissue for which the site of the primary tumor is yet unknown.

Among these, cytokeratin 13 (CK13) has gained attention as a potential biomarker in cancer research (see review: [Moll et al., 1982](https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(82)90400-7)). Previous studies have shown variable expression patterns across different cancer types [3].

## Methods

We performed immunohistochemical analysis on tissue microarrays containing 10,439 tumor samples. The expression was evaluated using standardized protocols described by [Remmele & Stegner, 1987](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3303008/).

## Results

CK13 expression was detected in various carcinomas with distinct patterns. High expression was observed in transitional cell carcinomas [5]. Lower expression levels were found in adenocarcinomas of different origins [6].

## Discussion

Our findings suggest that CK13 expression varies significantly between cancer types. This variability may have implications for diagnosis and prognosis as described in recent literature ([Karantza, 2011](https://doi.org/10.1038/onc.2010.456)). Further molecular studies are needed to understand the functional role [8].

## Conclusion

CK13 represents a useful biomarker for specific cancer types. The comprehensive analysis across 10,439 tumors provides valuable insights for clinical applications.
