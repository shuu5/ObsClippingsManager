## Abstract

Cytokeratin 13 (CK13) is a type I acidic low molecular weight cytokeratin, which is mainly expressed in urothelium and in the squamous epithelium of various sites of origin. Loss of CK13 has been implicated in the development and progression of squamous epithelial neoplasms [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0001). To comprehensively determine CK13 expression in normal and neoplastic tissues, a tissue microarray containing 10,439 samples from 131 different tumor types and subtypes as well as 608 samples of 76 different normal tissue types was analyzed by immunohistochemistry [2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0002).

## Introduction

Antibodies against cytokeratins are commonly used for immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses in surgical pathology because these proteins often show organ- and cell type specific expression, which is typically retained in cancers derived from these cells [3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0003), [4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0004). IHC detection of specific cytokeratins is useful to characterize metastatic cancer tissue for which the site of the primary tumor is yet unknown.

Cytokeratins (CKs) are intermediate filaments that protect cells against mechanical stress [5](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0005) - [7](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0007). They are present in virtually all epithelial cells and some other cell types where they braid the nucleus, span through the cytoplasm, and attach to the cytoplasmic plaques of the desmosomes. CKs form heteropolymers of type I (acidic) and type II (basic) filaments.

## Methodology

Cytokeratin 13 (CK13), encoded by the keratin 13 (KRT13) gene at chromosome 17q21, is a type I acidic low molecular weight cytokeratin [8, 9]. It mainly forms heterodimers with CK4 (type II) in squamous epithelium of various sites of origin, and with the simple-epithelium-type type II CKs 7 and/or 8 in the urothelium [10](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0010), [11](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/#apm13280-bib-0011).

Studies on CK13 expression in cancer have focused on neoplasms derived from the squamous epithelium. Several authors have found that reduced CK13 staining in squamous epithelium may represent a feature of dysplasia (Smith et al., 2020; Jones & Brown, 2019). Others have suggested that a reduced CK13 expression in these tumors may be linked to poor prognosis in squamous cell carcinomas from cervix [12-14], oral cavity [15-17], and head and neck [18], [19].

## Results

However, data on the prevalence of CK13 expression are controversial for many cancers. For example, the CK13 positivity rates of squamous cell carcinomas ranged from 33% to 80% in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung, 25–100% in squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix uteri [20, 21], and 0–49% in squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. These conflicting data are likely to be caused by using different antibodies, immunostaining protocols, and criteria to determine CK13 positivity in these studies (see reviews: [22]; [23]).

CK13 immunostaining was detectable in 42 (32.1%) of the 131 tumor categories including 24 (18.3%) tumor types with at least one strongly positive case. The highest rate of positive staining was found in various urothelial neoplasms (52.1–92.3%) including Brenner tumor of the ovary (86.8%) and in squamous cell carcinomas from various sites of origin (39.1–77.6%).

## Discussion

In bladder cancer, reduced CK13 expression was linked to high grade and advanced stage (p < 0.0001 each) (Johnson et al., 2021). In squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, reduced CK13 immunostaining was related to high grade (p = 0.0295) and shortened recurrence-free (p = 0.0094) and overall survival (p = 0.0274).

Our data provide a comprehensive overview on CK13 expression in normal and neoplastic human tissues. CK13 expression predominates in urothelial neoplasms and in squamous cell carcinomas of different organs, and a loss of CK13 expression is associated with aggressive disease in these tumors [24].

## Conclusion

To better understand the prevalence and significance of CK13 expression in cancer as well as the potential diagnostic utility of CK13 IHC, comprehensive studies analyzing large numbers of neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues under highly standardized conditions are needed. Therefore, CK13 expression was analyzed in more than 10,000 tumor tissue samples from 131 different tumor types and subtypes as well as 76 non-neoplastic tissue categories by IHC in a tissue microarray (TMA) format in this study.
