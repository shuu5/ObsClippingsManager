## Abstract

The prostate epithelium contains multiple cell types including luminal, basal, and neuroendocrine cells, with distinct keratin expression profiles that reflect their developmental lineage¹. Understanding the cellular hierarchy and stem cell populations in prostate tissue is crucial for elucidating cancer initiation and progression²,³. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting cellular heterogeneity⁴.

## Introduction

The prostate gland consists of a branched ductal system lined with secretory luminal cells, basal cells that provide structural support, and rare neuroendocrine cells⁵. Each cell type expresses characteristic markers, including specific keratin proteins⁶⁻⁸. Keratin expression patterns have been used to identify and characterize different prostate cell populations⁹,¹⁰.

Recent advances in single-cell technologies have revolutionized our understanding of tissue organization and stem cell biology¹¹. In the prostate, several studies have identified potential stem cell populations, but their relationship to cancer stem cells remains unclear¹²⁻¹⁴. Keratin profiling may provide insights into both normal stem cell hierarchy and cancer stem-like cell characteristics.

## Methods

### Tissue Collection and Processing

Normal prostate tissues were obtained from organ donors with appropriate ethical approval¹⁵. Cancer tissues were collected from radical prostatectomy specimens¹⁶,¹⁷. Single-cell suspensions were prepared using standard enzymatic digestion protocols¹⁸.

### Single-Cell RNA Sequencing

scRNA-seq was performed using the 10X Genomics platform¹⁹. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq system²⁰,²¹. Data analysis was performed using standard bioinformatics pipelines including Cell Ranger and Seurat²²⁻²⁴.

## Results

### Identification of Prostate Cell Populations

scRNA-seq analysis identified distinct cell clusters corresponding to luminal, basal, and stromal populations²⁵. Each population exhibited characteristic gene expression profiles, including specific keratin patterns²⁶,²⁷. Luminal cells highly expressed KRT8 and KRT18, while basal cells were characterized by KRT5 and KRT14 expression²⁸.

### Keratin Expression Defines Stem Cell Hierarchy

Detailed analysis revealed a hierarchical organization of prostate epithelial cells based on keratin expression²⁹⁻³¹. A rare population of cells expressed both basal and luminal keratins, suggesting they may represent bipotent stem cells³². These cells also expressed established stem cell markers including LGR5 and PROCR³³,³⁴.

### Cancer Stem-Like Cell Identification

Comparison between normal and cancer tissues revealed a distinct population of cancer stem-like cells with altered keratin profiles³⁵. These cells expressed high levels of KRT13, along with stem cell markers SOX2 and NANOG³⁶,³⁷. The cancer stem-like cells showed enhanced self-renewal capacity and resistance to standard therapies (Anderson et al., 2020; Taylor & Wilson, 2019).

## Discussion

Our keratin profiling approach has revealed new insights into prostate stem cell biology and cancer stem cell characteristics³⁸. The identification of KRT13-positive cancer stem-like cells provides a potential target for therapeutic intervention³⁹⁻⁴¹. These findings suggest that keratin expression patterns can serve as reliable markers for both normal and malignant stem cell populations.

The stem cell hierarchy we identified is consistent with previous studies but provides higher resolution mapping of cellular relationships⁴². The presence of bipotent stem cells expressing mixed keratin profiles supports the concept of cellular plasticity in prostate development and cancer⁴³⁻⁴⁵.

## Conclusion

Single-cell RNA sequencing combined with keratin profiling has identified the hierarchical organization of human prostate stem cells and characterized cancer stem-like cell populations. KRT13 emerges as a key marker of cancer stem-like cells, providing new opportunities for targeted therapy development⁴⁶. These findings advance our understanding of prostate biology and cancer pathogenesis (see comprehensive review: Thompson et al., 2021)⁴⁷.
